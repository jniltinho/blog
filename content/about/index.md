**Hello everyone! My name is Nilton, and I have been working in IT for over 10 years, with almost 8 of those years as an Infrastructure Analyst. I am passionate about technology and Linux, having been captivated by it even before the commercial internet arrived in Brazil.**

My expertise lies in Linux systems and open-source applications, as I have been managing Linux environments since 1999. I have spent most of my career working with infrastructure, primarily in Linux environments (90%) and fully virtualized setups using Xen Hypervisor with Citrix's XenServer.

I am also a self-taught programmer, having learned Perl, PHP, Python, and Golang the hard way, but not before starting with small Bash scripts.

My journey with Linux began with Slackware, then transitioned to Mandrake Desktop with KDE. Soon after, I discovered Carlos Morimoto's Kurumin Linux system and its fantastic scripts, which sparked my interest in understanding how those scripts worked.

This curiosity led me to explore programming, starting with Perl due to its similarity to Bash. I actively participated in various forums related to the Kurumin project, assisting with scripts. When Kurumin was nearing its end, I contributed to the Kurunin-NG Project and discovered the wonderful Python programming language.

My thirst for knowledge in the Linux world remained unquenched, so I took numerous courses ranging from web development (HTML, JavaScript), graphic design (Photoshop, Fireworks, Dreamweaver), video editing, and animation. Additionally, I am an avid hardware and networking enthusiast, having taken courses in networking, hardware, and electronics, as well as Linux networks with Carlos Morimoto.

I have been involved in various open-source projects, assisting with translations, bug reporting, and other tasks. For example, I contributed to translating Ubuntu packages in the early days with the help of my good friend, Og Maciel. Before diving into the IT world, I also dabbled in gymnastics, animation drawing, comic drawing, and photography.

Being an avid reader and video game lover, I embrace my geeky side. Today, I am a senior power user and administrator of Unix-like systems, managing environments with various distributions such as Debian, OpenSUSE, CentOS, and Ubuntu, among others. I actively participate in open-source projects like XenServer, Samba4, ISPConfig3, and NagiosQL, providing documentation, translations, scripts, tips, and more.

Throughout my professional journey, I have worked on various projects related to management, infrastructure and support, email migration to Zimbra or Postfix, virtualization, cloud computing with XenServer, virtualized desktops, domain services (AD) based on Samba4, Linux and Windows integration, web development with Golang, Python, and PHP, firewall environments, and web hosting servers using ISPConfig. I also monitor services using Nagios and NagiosQL.

Leveraging my strong knowledge of infrastructure and programming languages like Golang, Python, Perl, and PHP, I have earned several certifications in the IT world, including LPC-1, ITIL, SUSE Certified Linux Administrator, and various other IT, networking, and storage courses such as IPv6 in NIC.br, NetAPP, Nagios Hands-On in Real Time, and more. I participate in numerous communities (Python, Ruby, Perl, Ubuntu) and love sharing tutorials and tips on my blog.

I recognize that I still have much to learn, but I also have a wealth of knowledge to share. I invite you to explore my blog and its posts at your leisure, as well as visit my YouTube channel if you are interested in the subject matter or wish to delve deeper.
